*
*           ABAP cheat sheet: Constructor expressions
*
* -------------------------- PURPOSE ----------------------------------
* - Example to demonstrate the use of constructor expressions.
* - Topics covered: Operators VALUE, CORRESPONDING, NEW, CONV, EXACT, REF,
*   CAST, COND, SWITCH, FILTER, REDUCE, iteration expressions with FOR,
*   LET expressions
*
* ----------------------- GETTING STARTED -----------------------------
* - Open the class with the ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT).
* - Choose F9 to run the class.
* - Check the console output.
* - To understand the context and the ABAP syntax used, refer to the
*   notes included in the class as comments or refer to the respective
*   topic in the ABAP Keyword Documentation.
* - Due to the amount of console output, the examples contain numbers
*   (e.g. 1) ..., 2) ..., 3) ...) for the individual example sections.
*   Also, the variable name is displayed in most cases. So to find
*   the relevant output in the console easier and faster, just search
*   for the number/variable name in the console (CTRL+F in the console)
*   or use the debugger.
*
* ----------------------------- NOTE -----------------------------------
* The code presented in this class is intended only to support the ABAP
* cheat sheets. It is not intended for direct use in a production system
* environment. The code examples in the ABAP cheat sheets are primarily
* intended to provide a better explanation and visualization of the
* syntax and semantics of ABAP statements, not to solve concrete
* programming tasks. For production application programs, you should
* always work out your own solution for each individual case. There is
* no guarantee for the correctness or completeness of the code.
* Furthermore, there is no legal responsibility or liability for any
* errors or their consequences that may occur when using the the example
* code.
