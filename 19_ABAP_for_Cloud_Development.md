This ABAP cheat sheet briefly outlines the terms ABAP Cloud and classic ABAP to get an idea about [ABAP for Cloud Development](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_for_cloud_dev_glosry.htm). 
It provides references to more detailed information on the topic.

## Terms

- ABAP Cloud 
  - Progamming paradigm for state-of-the-art, cloud-ready and upgrade-stable solutions 
  - Based on a usage type of the [ABAP Platform](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_platform_glosry.htm), where the following restrictions apply:
    - [ABAP language version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_version_glosry.htm): 
      - The available ABAP language version is [ABAP for Cloud Development](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_for_cloud_dev_glosry.htm) that presents a [restricted ABAP language version](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrestricted_version_glosry.htm).
    - [Released APIs](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenreleased_api_glosry.htm):
      - Access to SAP-delivered repository objects is restricted to objects released for ABAP for Cloud Development
      - For example, most of the database tables provided by SAP cannot be read directly (although there are abstractions/CDS view entities for many that can be accessed).
      - Libraries are available with predefined functionality.
      - Note that repository objects can be classified by a [release contract](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenrelease_contract_glosry.htm) (e.g. C0, C1 etc.). 
    - Tools:
      - [ABAP development tools for Eclipse (ADT)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenadt_glosry.htm) are the only supported tools 
      - There is no access to SAP GUI (transactions `SE80`, `SE24` etc. you may know from classic ABAP)
  - The [ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenarap_glosry.htm) is the transactional programming model for ABAP Cloud.
  - Supported in both [SAP BTP ABAP Environment](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensap_btp_abap_env_glosry.htm) and [ABAP Platform Cloud](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_platform_cloud_glosry.htm).
- Classic ABAP
  - Progamming paradigm for legacy solutions
  - Based on an ABAP Platform without restrictions regarding ABAP language versions (i.e. you can use [Standard ABAP](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenstandard_abap_glosry.htm) - the unrestricted ABAP language version - and also ABAP for Cloud Development there), usage of tools (ADT and/or SAP GUI) or access to repository objects (also objects provided by SAP). 
  - Supported in [SAP S/4HANA](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abensap_s4hana_glosry.htm)

## Excursions

1) If available to you, you have accessed an SAP BTP ABAP environment using ADT.

    Access to SAP-provided repository objects is restricted to objects that have been released for ABAP for Cloud Development (released APIs). You can find the released repository objects in the *Project Explorer* view in ADT under *Released Objects*:

    ![Released APIs](./files/released_APIs.png)

    As an example of a released API, consider the `CL_ABAP_RANDOM_INT` class (computes random integers). In ADT, once you have opened the class, check the *Properties* tab. Click *API State* on the left to display information about the release contracts. In this case, it is C1. As mentioned above, see [here](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenabap_versions_and_apis.htm#@@ITOC@@ABENABAP_VERSIONS_AND_APIS_2) for more information on C1, and so on. This is also true for ABAP repository objects in classic ABAP.
   
    ![Release contract](./files/release_contract.png)

    For deprecated and invalid syntax in ABAP for Cloud Development, see the following code.
    For example, create a demo class and insert the code contained in the implementation into the `if_oo_adt_classrun~main` method. You will see several syntax errors.

    > **üí° Note**<br>
    > - The `IF_OO_ADT_CLASSRUN` interface is a released API. As the name implies, you can implement this interface to run an ABAP class. In ADT you can do this with *F9*. Of course, the example below will not run. The class cannot be activated because of the syntax errors. Note: To output the content of data objects, you can use `out->write( ... ).` in the `main` method.
    > - About the errros/warnings:
    >   - The first two ABAP SQL statements select from demo database tables. The first is a demo table provided by SAP. This table is not directly accessible in ABAP Cloud (unlike in classic ABAP) and therefore cannot be used as a data source to select from. The second one is a database table from the ABAP cheat sheet GitHub repository. If you have imported the repository into the system, you can use it as a data source.
    >   - The next set of ABAP SQL statements are dynamic statements. This is just to emphasize that you should be careful with dynamic statements. You will not get a syntax error at compile time. You can try out the following: Comment out all code except the lines with the dynamic statements, activate the code and run the class with `F9`. The result is a [runtime error](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_cp_index_htm/CLOUD/en-US/index.htm?file=abenruntime_error_glosry.htm) because you cannot select from the data source.
    >   - Examples for deprecated and invalid syntax in ABAP for Cloud Development are included. Among them, the invalid statement `MOVE ... TO` and others which are just included for demonstration purposes. To set breakpoints in ADT, double-click the area to the left of the code line number.

      ENDMETHOD.
    ENDCLASS.
    ```   

2) If available to you, you have accessed an on-premise ABAP system using ADT. It is assumed that the latest ABAP release is available. 

    a)  Checking API status information 
    - Choose `CTRL + SHIFT + A` to open the search in ADT. Search the class `CL_ABAP_RANDOM_INT`. Once you have opened the class, check the *Properties* tab and find the API status information. 
    
    b) Creating an example class
    - Create a global class and insert the code from above. Depending on the name of the class you created, replace the class name in the snippet.
     For the example class created, check the information in the *Properties* tab. Choose *General*. The *ABAP Language Version* is maintained as *Standard ABAP*: 
     ![Standard ABAP](./files/standard.png)
    - If you have not imported the ABAP cheat sheet GitHub repository, remove the lines of code using artifacts from that repository, i.e. remove the statements using objects starting with `Z...`. You should not see any syntax errors. Activate the class.     
    - Run the class with *F9*. The code should have been processed up to the `BREAK-POINT` statement and the debugger should have started. You may want to check the content of the variables in the debugger. Choose *Terminate* to exit the debugger.
    - So, unlike in the case of ABAP Cloud above, you should be able to activate and run the code (which does not represent a meaningful code example).    
     
    c) Verifying cloud-readiness of your code in classic ABAP
     - You have walked through b), created a class, inserted the code from above, and activated the class. The *ABAP Language Version* is maintained as *Standard ABAP* in the *Properties* tab. 
     - Verifying if your code is cloud-ready
       - You can use ATC check variant `ABAP_CLOUD_READINESS` for this purpose.
       - For example, in your class, right-click and choose *Run As* ‚Üí *4 ABAP Test Cockpit With...*. Enter `ABAP_CLOUD_READINESS` in the pop-up window and choose *Ok*. The ATC check run is started. 
       - As a result of the ATC check run (note that it may take a while to complete), the *ATC Problems* tab in ADT should display results. In this case, these are the errors and warnings mentioned above, indicating that the code is not cloud-ready in various places. Double-click on the findings for more detailed information. 

    d) Cloud-ready development in classic ABAP
     - You have walked through b), created a class, inserted the code from above, and activated the class. The *ABAP Language Version* is maintained as *Standard ABAP* in the *Properties* tab under *General*. 
     - Suppose you want to do cloud-ready development and use ABAP for Cloud Development, i.e. the restricted ABAP language version, in classic ABAP (e.g. an on-premise ABAP system that allows the unrestricted ABAP language version). 
     - Open the *Properties* tab and choose *General* for this purpose. 
     - Choose the *Edit...* button to the right of the *ABAP Language Version* property.
     - Select *ABAP for Cloud Development* in the pop-up window and choose *Ok*.
     - You will then be able to work with a repository object with the restrictions mentioned above. As a result, the example class with the code snippets will have syntax errors and cannot be activated. In more meaningful, productive development contexts, appropriate refactoring is required.

> **üí° Note**<br>
> - The executable example ...
>   - does not focus - unlike other ABAP cheat sheet examples - on ABAP syntax as such (the other non-Standard-ABAP cheat sheet examples focus on ABAP syntax available in ABAP for Cloud Development), but rather emphasizes released APIs and libraries that provide predefined functionality and can be used in ABAP for Cloud Development. In particular, the Extension Components Library (XCO) is used.
>   - covers an arbitrary selection for you to explore. For more detailed information and code snippets, see the SAP Help Portal documentation [here](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/sap-business-technology-platform?version=Cloud) and [here about XCO](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/xco-library?version=Cloud). In most cases, the example covers a selection of classes and methods for retrieving information about repository objects. It is more of a "playground" for exploring the APIs with a few snippets of code, and should be seen as an invitation to more in-depth exploration.
